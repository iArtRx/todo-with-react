#A To-Do App with React

I am currently going through The Odin Project and its Javascript curriculum. One of its projects is a To-Do App. As I was working on the project, I found myself simultaneously enjoying working out problems and also getting frustrated by them. This process was expected, but it did not deter me from trying to learn more. I am a perfectionist by nature and would like my organisation to be translated into my code. As a novice this is near impossible and as I am scaling up the project (To me it is scaling but to others it might be just basic haha). I was having trouble updating the DOM after a new task was added, I managed to figure out a workaround but my code ended up being messier. I will continue to work on that project with just Javascript but while I was researching about state, using React was often suggested. At the same time I was given an assignment by a potential employer to create a To-Do app, so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to learn React. The aim of this project is to create a functioning app while learning React.
